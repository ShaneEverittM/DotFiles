# This script is for when you want to write a rule that depends on runtime information about a window.
# Every window that is spawned is triggers this script by setting:
# 	bspc config external_rules_command="/path/to/this/file"
# When this script is ran, bspwm sends the wid, and the two parts of the wm_class, the class and the instance.
# Any bspc rule flags echo'd will be applied to the window that just opened.

# Here I could do the thing I wanted where the first window to open on a monitor is centered, but subsequent ones tile.
